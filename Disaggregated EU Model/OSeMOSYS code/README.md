# OSeMOSYS code for CLEWs-EU model
This is the version of the OSeMOSYS code that has been created for this project. The file is in the form of a text file and describes all the parameters, variables and constraints (i.e., equations) that describe the relationship between input data (i.e., parameters) and model outputs (i.e., variables).
