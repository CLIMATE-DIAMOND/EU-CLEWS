# OSeMOSYS code for CLEWs-EU model
This is the version of the OSeMOSYS code that has been created for this project. The file is in the form of a text file and describes all the parameters, variables and constraints (i.e., equations) that describe the relationship between input data (i.e., parameters) and model outputs (i.e., variables).

The code _OSeMOSYS_CLEWs-EU_annual.txt_ should be used to run the following models:
- Land & Water Module
- Buildings sector model
- Industrial sector model
- Transport sector model

The code _OSeMOSYS_CLEWs-EU_multi_yr.txt_ should be used to run the following models:
- Integrated CLEWs-EU model
- Integrated Energy module

The code _OSeMOSYS_CLEWs-EU_multi_yr_el_h.txt_ should be used to run the following models:
- Electricity & heat generation model

The respective confi.yaml files provided here should be used when converting the available model data files from Excel to csv/datafile format, using [Otoole](https://otoole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
