# Rail Transport Data Processing

This folder contains the following files:
1) Country Codes.xlsx: An excel file that has the country code for each country in the model
2) rail_transport_function_final.py: A python file that acts as a function, analysing data for each country
3) rail_transport_process_final.py: A python file that processes data for each country via the file rail_transport_function_final.py, following an iterative process

## Installation:

To use the python code you need to install python and the associated libraries.

It is suggested to install python by downloading the [Anaconda or Miniconda]([url](https://www.anaconda.com/download)) distribution and follow the installation instructions. Miniconda is a more light version of python distribution with fewer libraries installed.

Similary, you can install [pandas]([url](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)) following the instructions in its documentation.

## Instructions:

Please note that to run the file rail_transport_function_final.py you need to define the path in which you have the downoladed the JRC database. There is a comment denoting the respective section at the beginning of the script. The results will be created in a separate file in the folder of each country.
