## Electricity
The electricity supply model accounts for a wide range of technologies which comprise a portfolio of projects to be considered in the optimisation. The technological mix of conventional generators can be distinguished based on the thermodynamic cycle (steam (ST) vs gas, open vs closed cycle vs combined cycle (CCGT)), and on the fuel (biomass, nuclear, coal, natural gas, liquid fuels, waste, biogas etc.). The model also includes CCS for specific technologies, coal-ST with CCS, gas CCGT with CCS and biomass-ST with CCS. Additionally, the model includes two types of electricity storage namely battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro. 
PV and wind generation profiles are adjusted to get the average annual capacity factor based on Eurostat. Wind and PV resources have been broken into high, average and low potential. For each country there are 3 PV and wind technologies/resources associated with a different capacity factor (%) and economic potential (in GW).
Run-of-River (RoR) hydro generation is modelled similarly as in the case of PV and wind, using historical profile of generation, and adjusted to get the average capacity factor based on historical data by Eurostat. The hourly profiles of demand, as well as generation from PV, wind and RoR have been treated and adjusted to the temporal resolution that is used across the CLEWs model.
Hydro plants with dams are modelled as generators running on water (represented as a “fuel”), while the maximum capacity factor is capped based on historical generation. The main difference between RoR and hydro with dams is that hydro with dams can operate flexibly. All adopted profiles for hydro, PV and wind have been compared with historical data based on Eurostat and have been treated to represent an average year. For this purpose, historical annual averages have been obtained from 1980-2019 for PV and Wind and 2015-2022 for hydro. 

## Heat
The heat module of the power section of the CLEWs model contains CHP plants with a main purpose to produce electricity, while heat is directed as a by-product into district heating networks. CHP units that are part of industrial facilities are not part of this module, as end-use energy demand in industry is accounted for in that sector separately.
In order to vary the level of electricity and heat production throughout the model horizon and the intra-annual timesteps, we have added two modes of operation for each CHP technology. The first mode represents the maximum rate of electricity production for the CHP unit, while the highest heat-rate production is accounted for in the other mode. Depending on the level of electricity versus heat demand in the end-use sectors, the model chooses which of the two modes to prioritise.
