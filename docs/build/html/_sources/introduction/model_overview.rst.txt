Model Overview
==============

Development of the various sectors of the model was parallelised, based on separate entities, which also offer the possibility of running specific sectoral models in isolation (Figure 1). The latest version of the disaggregated CLEWs-EU model is made available, but also the first versions of the sectoral modules (land & water, electricity & heat, buildings, industry, transport) are released with this version of the model.

The figure below summarises the high-level interconnections:
