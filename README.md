# Land-Water Modules

I've just uplodaed the a template of the Land-Water Modules (aggragated EU model) for use with Otoole
Currenlty only Technologies and Fuels have been added (and there input-output relationship) 
Soem uncertainites with the model structure:

- Do we need a potential for crop land land technology if we already have specific crop land technologies? (currently exlcuded from the template)
- which crops for biofuel? (we currently have technologies for both biodiesal and bioethanal) 
- I have excluded the technology 'land for protected tree cover' for now 
- please check if Seawater techs and fules are coherent in the technology list/ Referece diagram -on shared drive

I have also uploaded a couple of python scripts to aid populating the template quicker
